        <h2>Group Travel: Our Specialty!</h2>
        <p>Travel With Barb specializes in group trips—mainly student group trips. The Travel With Barb staff combined has nearly 150 years of teaching experience! We know what it takes to plan and implement a successful, meaningful, and memorable trip for you and your students. We promise that we will be with you every step of the way. Over the years we have developed relationships with many partners to get you what you need at an affordable rate. Some added values of using Travel With Barb as your trip coordinator include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Custom itinerary planning assistance</li>
          <li>Letters, handouts, and trip information for your students/parents</li>
          <li>Safe hotels with interior corridors</li>
          <li>Knowledgeable, experienced tour director (if requested)</li>
          <li>Experience working with music festivals, bowl games and parades</li>
          <li>Parent/Chaperone meetings</li>
          <li>Packing lists</li>
          <li>Payment Plans</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Why be both Travel Agent AND Teacher?</h3>
        <h4>We do the planning while you do the teaching!</h4>
        <p>A successful trip means ensuring the safety of your group, efficiency in the tour, and having all the logistics in place. At Travel With Barb, we take pride in our ability to offer these things for you so you can focus on the most important thing – your students. A great travel experience changes lives, and creates life-long memories. Your trip preparations shouldn’t take away time from your teaching responsibilities. Plus, if you are busy handling the logistics and tour planning for your group, you will have less time to enjoy this rewarding opportunity with your students.</p>
        <h4>Cost effective planning.</h4>
        <p>Whether it’s choosing a good hotel location in relation to your group tour activities, securing special rates at key attractions, or handling food and beverage options that are a good “fit” for students, Travel With Barb has the relationships and resources with these vendors to help you get the best VALUE for your dollar.</p>
        <h4>Peace of mind.</h4>
        <p>Relying on the experience and expertise of a Travel With Barb tour planner can bring peace of mind to you the teacher, to parents of your students, and to your school administrators. Our experienced tour planners can anticipate the unexpected, and will deliver a level of preparedness that’s hard to match when you plan on your own.</p>
        <p>At Travel With Barb, we pride ourselves on our integrity and outstanding service. Our job is to work closely with you to ensure your group has a valuable, educational, and memorable travel experience.</p>
